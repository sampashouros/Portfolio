  # Design score.py:
    # This is a script to take Moodle data and Panopto data, and based on certain metrics, give them a score from 0-1
    # based on how well designed a module is. Essentially, if they are using Moodle and Panopto to it's fullest, they will score
    # higher.
    # It also scores each module on their engagement, 'Quality' and 'Level'. Quality is measuring when a student has actually
    # engaged with an activity (like posting on a forum). Level is just clicks on a module page, and views on a Panopto video.
    # It will then visualise design vs these engagement metrics to see their relationships.
